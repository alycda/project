# Step 2 — Download Manifest

Produces `_docs/research/downloads.yaml`.

## The Original Prompt (subject to user modifications)

> Look through _docs/research. I want to produce a list of unique URLs and repos which will be downloaded to act as prior art for our upcoming project.
>
> Because research results will continue to stream in from other researchers, create a _docs/research/downloads.yaml to track which papers, repos, articles etc have already been downloaded. The format should be suitable for idempotent upsert as new URLs are discovered.

## Dispatch

Step 2 runs on a **Haiku Agent sub-agent**, not the parent's frontier model. The work is structured extraction — URL detection, normalization, classification — which Haiku handles at a fraction of the Opus/Sonnet cost with no measurable regression on this task. Frontier models stay reserved for Steps 0, 1, and 1.5.

Invoke via the Agent tool with `model: "haiku"`:

```
Agent({
    description: "Build research downloads manifest",
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    model: "haiku",
    prompt: "<the Procedure section below + project root path>"
})
```

The sub-agent reads the markdown files in `_docs/research/`, extracts URLs, classifies them, and writes the manifest. If Haiku produces a misclassification you can spot during Step 3 downloads, re-run that one entry through the parent provider — don't escalate the whole step.

## Procedure

1. Scan `_docs/research/*.md` for cited URLs. This now includes up to **six** input files: the Step 1.5 inline-worker outputs (`{claude,codex,gemini}.md` for Mode B or `{theory,tooling,industry}.md` for Mode C) AND the Step 1.6 hosted Deep Research outputs (`{claude,chatgpt,gemini}-deep-research.md`). Prefer the explicit "Source ledger" section if present; fall back to scraping URLs from prose.
2. Deduplicate, normalize (canonical arxiv form, strip query strings, expand short URLs), and classify (`paper` / `repo` / `article` / `docs` / `other`).
3. **Determine `license` for each new URL** — see "Licensing at manifest time" below.
4. Read existing `_docs/research/downloads.yaml` if it exists.
5. Upsert: add new URLs as `status: pending`; preserve existing entries' `status`, `path`, `license`, `accessed`, `archived`, `flags`, and `notes` fields. Track `cited_in` membership across ALL six files — the same URL cited by both `claude.md` (CLI) and `claude-deep-research.md` (hosted) gets both names in its `cited_in` list.
6. Write `_docs/research/downloads.yaml`.

## Licensing at manifest time

Step 2 is the only cheap moment to record license status. The URL is already in
hand; recovering the same answer for 200 sources a week later means reopening 200
tabs. `SOURCE-POLICY.md` in the project root is the authority on what the values
mean — this step just captures them.

Set `license` to an [SPDX identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/), or to one of the
two allowed non-SPDX values. Domain heuristics get most entries right without a
fetch:

| Pattern | `license` | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `arxiv.org/abs/<id>` | per-paper — check the abstract page's license line | arXiv papers range from `CC-BY-4.0` to arXiv's own non-exclusive license. Do **not** assume open. |
| `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` | read the repo's LICENSE / `licenseInfo` | No LICENSE file → `LicenseRef-all-rights-reserved`, not "probably MIT". |
| `stackoverflow.com`, `*.stackexchange.com` | `CC-BY-SA-4.0` | Site ToS is the grant (3.0 before 2018). These are **not** all-rights-reserved. |
| `en.wikipedia.org` | `CC-BY-SA-4.0` | Same — ToS grant. |
| `*.gov` (US federal) | likely public domain, but **verify authorship** | 17 U.S.C. § 105 covers federal *employees*. Contractor-authored works on a `.gov` domain are copyrighted. Domain is not proof. |
| Blogs, news, vendor docs | `LicenseRef-all-rights-reserved` | The correct default. Absence of a license is not ambiguity. |
| Anything you could not determine | `LicenseRef-unknown` + `flags: [status-unverified]` | An honest unknown beats a confident guess. Handled as all-rights-reserved downstream. |

Set `flags` at the same time: `noncommercial-only` for any `CC-BY-NC-*`,
`sharealike-integrated` for `*-SA-*` and copyleft code licenses (`GPL`, `AGPL`,
`LGPL`, `MPL`), `status-unverified` where you guessed.

**Do not fetch pages solely to determine a license.** `LicenseRef-unknown` costs
nothing and Step 3 is where the fetch happens anyway; a hundred extra HTTP requests
during manifest-building is the wrong trade. Use what the URL and the research
reports already tell you.

## Output

See `templates/downloads.yaml.example` for format. Each entry has:

- `url` — canonical URL (the upsert key)
- `kind` — paper | repo | article | docs | other
- `title` — short human-readable title
- `cited_in` — list of researcher-ids that cited this (e.g., `[claude, codex]` for Mode B, `[theory, tooling]` for Mode C)
- `status` — pending | downloading | done | failed | skipped
- `path` — local path under `_inspiration/` once downloaded; null otherwise
- `license` — SPDX identifier, or `LicenseRef-all-rights-reserved` / `LicenseRef-unknown`
- `accessed` — ISO 8601 fetch date (Step 3 fills this)
- `archived` — snapshot URL, or `none  # save failed <date>, <reason>` (Step 3 fills this)
- `flags` — `[]` or any of `noncommercial-only`, `sharealike-integrated`, `status-unverified`
- `sha256` — digest for load-bearing sources; omit otherwise
- `notes` — optional, for manual annotations

## Verification

- All `_docs/research/*.md` URLs appear in the yaml
- No duplicate `url` values
- Existing entries' `status`, `path`, `notes` preserved across re-runs
- yaml validates against the schema in `templates/downloads.yaml.example`

## Pitfalls

- **URL normalization.** `arxiv.org/abs/2406.12345` and `arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12345v2.pdf` and `arxiv.org/abs/2406.12345v2` are the same paper. Pick a canonical form (recommended: `arxiv.org/abs/<id>`, no version) and normalize before deduping.
- **Repo URLs vs. file URLs.** `github.com/owner/repo` (clone the repo) vs. `github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/file.py` (just save the file). Classify correctly so Step 3 uses the right downloader.
- **Source ledger trust.** Some researchers cite secondary sources (Medium reposts, paper summaries) instead of primaries. Flag suspicious URLs in `notes` but don't drop them — let the user decide.
- **Re-runs after Step 1.5 streams in more researchers.** This is the core reason for upsert. Don't lose existing `status: done` / `path:` annotations on re-run.
- **Short URLs and redirects.** `bit.ly/...`, `tinyurl/...`, `t.co/...` should be expanded before storing. Some shorteners 404 over time.
- **Haiku misclassification.** Haiku is good at all four sub-tasks (detect / normalize / classify / flag) but a misclassified `github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/file.py` as `repo` causes Step 3 to `git clone` something that should be a single-file save. If you see any Step 3 download failures attributable to wrong `kind`, escalate that one entry's classification to the parent provider — don't escalate the whole step.
- **Mode B + Mode C output coexisting.** If both modes ran on the same project, you'll have up to six `*.md` files in `_docs/research/` from Step 1.5 alone. Step 2 should ingest all of them; the `cited_in` field will track which subset cited each URL.
- **Hosted DR arxiv hallucination.** Step 1.6's `*-deep-research.md` files are known to occasionally cite plausible-looking arXiv IDs that don't resolve (e.g., IDs dated after the current month, or wildly out-of-domain papers). Step 2 should accept them as `kind: paper` and let Step 3's download phase fail loudly on the 404 — that's the natural check. For arXiv IDs dated after the current month, add a `notes: "post-dated arxiv ID — verify before download"` flag so the user can spot-check.
- **`cited_in` membership across CLI + DR.** A URL cited by both the CLI Claude worker (`claude.md`) and the hosted Claude DR (`claude-deep-research.md`) should appear in `cited_in` as `[claude, claude-deep-research]` — not deduped to one. This lets downstream verification distinguish "everyone agrees this matters" from "only the hosted DR found this."
